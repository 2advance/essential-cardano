# essential-cardano
Welcome to the [Essential Cardano list](https://github.com/input-output-hk/essential-cardano/blob/main/essential-cardano-list.md#the-essential-cardano-list), a central source for all things Cardano-related. We have outlined all the organizations, partners, and groups that are part of the Cardano ecosystem, as well as a comprehensive collection of resources to help you learn more about Cardano. Whether you want to understand what Cardano is, learn about our mission and roadmap, or get stuck in and build on Cardano, this is the place to start. 

Essential Cardano is a list that is designed as a central library of materials, a one stop shop where you can find various resources for Cardano. This list includes official resources and community-generated materials. 

This is an open source repository that is initiated and overseen by myself [Niamh Ahern](https://iohk.io/en/team/niamh-ahern), [Ben O'Hanlon](https://iohk.io/en/team/ben-ohanlon), and [Tim Harrison](https://iohk.io/en/team/tim-harrison), all at IO Global. We encourage you to contribute and help us evolve this list, but please do not reproduce it. 

## Want to contribute?
We would love to hear your suggestions and ideas on what else we could include in Essential Cardano and how we can grow our list. Please get in touch with us and raise a pull request on this repo with new suggestions and additions to enhance our list. We review these regularly and will provide our feedback on each individual pull request.

## Disclaimer 
This list serves as a canonical reference and educational resource to help you navigate our growing ecosystem. Inclusion in the Essential Cardano list *does not constitute offical endorsement by IOG*.
